1|import {} from \"./Import\"
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I found an import cycle:

Entrypoint.mad
  -> Import.mad
    -> Entrypoint.mad

Hint: Import cycles are not allowed and usually show a design issue. Consider splitting things in more
modules in order to have both modules import a common dependency instead of having them being co-dependent.
Another solution would be to move things that depend on the other module from the cycle into the other in
order to collocate things that depend on each other.
