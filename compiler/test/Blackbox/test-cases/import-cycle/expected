  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I found an import cycle:

compiler/test/Blackbox/test-cases/import-cycle/Entrypoint.mad
  -> /Users/arnaudboeglin/Code/madlib/compiler/test/Blackbox/test-cases/import-cycle/Import.mad
    -> /Users/arnaudboeglin/Code/madlib/compiler/test/Blackbox/test-cases/import-cycle/Entrypoint.mad
      -> /Users/arnaudboeglin/Code/madlib/compiler/test/Blackbox/test-cases/import-cycle/Import.mad

Hint: Import cycles are not allowed and usually show a design issue. Consider splitting things in more
modules in order to have both modules import a common dependency instead of having them being co-dependent.
Another solution would be to move things that depend on the other module from the cycle into the other in
order to collocate things that depend on each other.
