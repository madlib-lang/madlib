     •    
     •    Entrypoint.mad
     •      -> Import.mad
     •        -> Entrypoint.mad

     │ Note: Import cycles are not allowed and usually show a design issue.
     │ Hint: Consider splitting things in more modules in order to have
     │       both modules import a common dependency instead of having
     │       them being co-dependent.
     │ Hint: Another solution would be to move
     │       things that depend on the other module from the cycle into
     │       the other in order to collocate things that depend on each
     │       other.
