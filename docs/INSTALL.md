Predominantly there are two ways you can install `madlib` today.

# Via Node

Depending on your preferences, either of these should be identical in behavior. 
- `yarn global add @madlib-lang/madlib`
- `npm install @madlib-lang/madlib -g`

# Via Source Code

1. `git clone https://github.com/madlib-lang/madlib.git madlib`
2. `cd madlib`
3. `nix something something?` (I need help here)
